# Tester Web Crawler

A Web Crawler Designed For Testing

Not even close to finished.

Started this a few years back.

Originally it was using PhantomJS to allow screenshots as it crawled and some other features.

Ripped that out for release to github and hastily converted to JSoup just to get it back working again.

I would not class this as good code as it is a prototype hack. Lots to do.
